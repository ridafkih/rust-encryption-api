Can you split this into two functions? One called `decrypt_api_handler` and one called `decrypt`

```rust
async fn decrypt_handler(_request: HttpRequest, body: web::Json<DecryptRequest>) -> HttpResponse {
    let ciphertext_string = body.ciphertext.to_string();

    // Split the ciphertext into the nonce and ciphertext parts
    let nonce_string = &ciphertext_string[ciphertext_string.len() - 48..];
    let ciphertext_string = &ciphertext_string[..ciphertext_string.len() - 48];

    // Decode the nonce and ciphertext from hexadecimal
    let nonce_bytes = hex::decode(nonce_string).expect("Failed to decode nonce");
    let nonce = secretbox::Nonce::from_slice(nonce_bytes.as_slice()).unwrap();
    let ciphertext = hex::decode(ciphertext_string).expect("Failed to decode ciphertext");

    // Decode the key from hexadecimal and convert it to a secretbox key
    let key_bytes = hex::decode(&body.key).expect("Failed to decode key");
    let key = sodiumoxide::crypto::secretbox::Key::from_slice(&key_bytes)
        .expect("Failed to convert key to Key");

    // Decrypt the ciphertext and return the result
    let plaintext = match secretbox::open(&ciphertext, &nonce, &key) {
        Ok(plaintext) => plaintext,
        Err(_) => return HttpResponse::BadRequest().body("Failed to decrypt ciphertext"),
    };
    HttpResponse::Ok().json(DecryptResponse {
        plaintext: String::from_utf8(plaintext).expect("Failed to convert plaintext to string"),
    })
}
```

### GPT-3

Sure! Here is a refactored version of the code:

```rust
async fn decrypt_api_handler(_request: HttpRequest, body: web::Json<DecryptRequest>) -> HttpResponse {
    let result = decrypt(&body.ciphertext, &body.key);
    match result {
        Ok(plaintext) => HttpResponse::Ok().json(DecryptResponse { plaintext }),
        Err(error) => HttpResponse::BadRequest().body(error),
    }
}

fn decrypt(ciphertext: &str, key: &str) -> Result<String, &'static str> {
    // Split the ciphertext into the nonce and ciphertext parts
    let nonce_string = &ciphertext[ciphertext.len() - 48..];
    let ciphertext_string = &ciphertext[..ciphertext.len() - 48];

    // Decode the nonce and ciphertext from hexadecimal
    let nonce_bytes = hex::decode(nonce_string).map_err(|_| "Failed to decode nonce")?;
    let nonce = secretbox::Nonce::from_slice(nonce_bytes.as_slice())
        .map_err(|_| "Failed to convert nonce bytes to Nonce")?;
    let ciphertext = hex::decode(ciphertext_string).map_err(|_| "Failed to decode ciphertext")?;

    // Decode the key from hexadecimal and convert it to a secretbox key
    let key_bytes = hex::decode(key).map_err(|_| "Failed to decode key")?;
    let key = sodiumoxide::crypto::secretbox::Key::from_slice(&key_bytes)
        .map_err(|_| "Failed to convert key to Key")?;

    // Decrypt the ciphertext and return the result
    secretbox::open(&ciphertext, &nonce, &key)
        .map_err(|_| "Failed to decrypt ciphertext")
        .map(|plaintext| String::from_utf8(plaintext).expect("Failed to convert plaintext to string"))
}
```

In the refactored code, the decrypt_api_handler function simply delegates to the decrypt function, which takes the ciphertext and key as separate arguments and returns a Result indicating whether the decryption was successful or not. The decrypt function also handles any errors that may occur during the decryption process and returns an appropriate error message.

### @ridafkih

no method named `map_err` found for enum `std::option::Option` in the current scoperustcE0599

### GPT-3

You're correct, there is no map_err method on the Option enum in the Rust standard library. To handle errors when converting the nonce and ciphertext strings to byte arrays, you can use the map_or method on Option, which allows you to provide a default value to use if the Option is None.

Here is an updated version of the decrypt function that uses map_or to handle errors when converting the nonce and ciphertext strings to byte arrays:

```rust
fn decrypt(ciphertext: &str, key: &str) -> Result<String, &'static str> {
    // Split the ciphertext into the nonce and ciphertext parts
    let nonce_string = &ciphertext[ciphertext.len() - 48..];
    let ciphertext_string = &ciphertext[..ciphertext.len() - 48];

    // Decode the nonce and ciphertext from hexadecimal
    let nonce_bytes = hex::decode(nonce_string).map_or(Err("Failed to decode nonce"), |bytes| Ok(bytes))?;
    let nonce = secretbox::Nonce::from_slice(nonce_bytes.as_slice())
        .map_or(Err("Failed to convert nonce bytes to Nonce"), |nonce| Ok(nonce))?;
    let ciphertext = hex::decode(ciphertext_string).map_or(Err("Failed to decode ciphertext"), |bytes| Ok(bytes))?;

    // Decode the key from hexadecimal and convert it to a secretbox key
    let key_bytes = hex::decode(key).map_or(Err("Failed to decode key"), |bytes| Ok(bytes))?;
    let key = sodiumoxide::crypto::secretbox::Key::from_slice(&key_bytes)
        .map_or(Err("Failed to convert key to Key"), |key| Ok(key))?;

    // Decrypt the ciphertext and return the result
    secretbox::open(&ciphertext, &nonce, &key)
        .map_err(|_| "Failed to decrypt ciphertext")
        .map(|plaintext| String::from_utf8(plaintext).expect("Failed to convert plaintext to string"))
}
```

In this code, the map_or method is used to handle the None case by returning an Err with an appropriate error message. If the Option is Some, then the value inside is returned as a Result, allowing the ? operator to handle any errors that may occur in the rest of the function.

### @ridafkih

Can I put these into their own files? If so, how?

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct EncryptRequest {
    plaintext: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct EncryptResponse {
    ciphertext: String,
    key: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct DecryptRequest {
    ciphertext: String,
    key: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct DecryptResponse {
    plaintext: String,
}
```

### GPT-3

Yes, you can put these structs into their own files. To do so, you can create a new file called models.rs in the same directory as your main Rust file. Then, you can move the struct definitions into the models.rs file.

Here is an example of how your models.rs file might look:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct EncryptRequest {
    plaintext: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct EncryptResponse {
    ciphertext: String,
    key: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct DecryptRequest {
    ciphertext: String,
    key: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct DecryptResponse {
    plaintext: String,
}
```

Once you have moved the struct definitions into their own file, you will need to import the structs into your main Rust file. You can do this by adding the following line at the top of your main Rust file:

```rust
mod models;
```

This line tells Rust to look for a file named models.rs in the same directory as your main Rust file and to import the contents of that file into your main Rust file. You can then use the structs in your main Rust file by prefixing them with the models:: namespace, like this:

```rust
let request = models::EncryptRequest { plaintext: "hello".to_string() };
```

### @ridafkih

struct `EncryptRequest` is private
private structrustcE0603

### GPT-3

The struct definitions in the models.rs file are private by default, which means that they are not visible outside of the models module. In order for the structs to be accessible from outside the models module, you need to make them public.

To make the structs public, you can add the pub keyword before the struct keyword in each struct definition. Here is an example of how your models.rs file might look with the structs made public:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
pub struct EncryptRequest {
    pub plaintext: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct EncryptResponse {
    pub ciphertext: String,
    pub key: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize)]
pub struct DecryptRequest {
    pub ciphertext: String,
    pub key: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub struct DecryptResponse {
    pub plaintext: String,
}
```

Once you have made the structs public, you will be able to use them in your main Rust file without any issues. For more information on visibility in Rust, see the Rust programming language documentation.

### @ridafkih

Can I put these functions into their own files?

### GPT-3

Yes, you can put the functions into their own files. Just like with the struct definitions, you can create a new file in the same directory as your main Rust file and move the function definitions into that file.

For example, you could create a new file called encrypt.rs and move the encrypt and encrypt_api_handler functions into that file. Here is an example of how your encrypt.rs file might look:

```rust
use sodiumoxide::crypto::secretbox;
use sodiumoxide::crypto::secretbox::Key;
use sodiumoxide::crypto::secretbox::Nonce;

use models::EncryptRequest;
use models::EncryptResponse;

use actix_web::{web, HttpRequest, HttpResponse};

use rand::Rng;

fn encrypt(plaintext: &str, key: &Key) -> EncryptResponse {
    // Generate a random nonce
    let mut nonce_bytes = [0; secretbox::NONCEBYTES];
    rand::thread_rng().fill_bytes(&mut nonce_bytes);
    let nonce = Nonce::from_slice(&nonce_bytes).unwrap();

    // Encrypt the plaintext and return the result
    let ciphertext = secretbox::seal(plaintext.as_bytes(), &nonce, key);
    EncryptResponse {
        ciphertext: hex::encode(&ciphertext),
        key: hex::encode(&key.0),
    }
}

pub async fn encrypt_api_handler(_request: HttpRequest, body: web::Json<EncryptRequest>) -> HttpResponse {
    // Generate a random key
    let mut key_bytes = [0; secretbox::KEYBYTES];
    rand::thread_rng().fill_bytes(&mut key_bytes);
    let key = Key::from_slice(&key_bytes).unwrap();

    // Encrypt the plaintext and return the result
    let response = encrypt(&body.plaintext, &key);
    HttpResponse::Ok().json(response)
}
```

Once you have moved the functions into their own file, you will need to import them into your main Rust file. You can do this by adding the following line at the top of your main Rust file:

```rust
mod encrypt;
```

This line tells Rust to look for a file named encrypt.rs in the same directory as your main Rust file and to import the contents of that file into your main Rust file. You can then use the functions in your main Rust file by prefixing them with the encrypt:: namespace, like this:

```rust
let response = encrypt::encrypt_api_handler(request, body);
```

For more information on modules in Rust, see the Rust programming language documentation.

### @ridafkih

How can I import the functions from a file nested in a folder with rust?

### GPT-3

To import functions from a file that is nested inside a folder, you can use the use keyword with the crate keyword to specify the path to the file. Here is an example of how you might import the encrypt and encrypt_api_handler functions from a file nested inside a folder called crypto:

```rust
use crate::crypto::encrypt;

fn encrypt_api_handler() {
    // Call the encrypt_api_handler function from the encrypt.rs file
    encrypt::encrypt_api_handler(request, body);
}
```

In this example, the use keyword is used with the crate keyword to import the encrypt module from the crypto folder. The crate keyword tells Rust to look for the encrypt module in the current crate (i.e. the current Rust project), and the ::crypto specifies that the module is nested inside the crypto folder.

Once you have imported the functions from the nested file, you can use them in your code by prefixing them with the encrypt:: namespace, as shown in the example above.

For more information on using the use keyword to import items from other modules, see the Rust programming language documentation.

### @ridafkih

unresolved import `crate::endpoints`
could not find `endpoints` in the crate rootrustcE0432

I'm getting his even those I have an endpoints folder with the files inside them

### GPT-3

It looks like you are trying to import a module named endpoints that is located in a folder of the same name. In order for this import to work, the folder and the module inside it must be declared as a module in your Rust code.

To declare a module that is located inside a folder, you can use the mod keyword followed by the name of the module and the path to the file that contains the module. Here is an example of how you might declare a endpoints module that is located inside a endpoints folder:

```rust
mod endpoints {
    pub mod endpoints {
        pub fn encrypt_api_handler() {
            // Implement encrypt_api_handler function
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the mod keyword is used to declare a new module named endpoints, and the pub mod endpoints line inside the endpoints module declares a submodule named endpoints that is located in the endpoints folder. The pub keyword before each mod keyword makes the endpoints and endpoints submodules public, which means they can be used outside of the endpoints module.

Once you have declared the endpoints module and its endpoints submodule, you can import them into your main Rust file using the use keyword. Here is an example of how you might import the encrypt_api_handler function from the endpoints module:

```rust
use crate::endpoints::endpoints;
```
